Computer Graphics - HW 5 Animation

Recreated Lionsgate gear animation that runs about 15-20 seconds in duration.  The clip
I try to replicate can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX4rMOsFJWE

The clip begins with a gradual increase in the lighting from complete darkness to "normal" as seen
in the Lionsgate clip.  During your animation, the camera moves utilizing a Bezier curve.  All gears
are spinning and some are attached to shafts.
